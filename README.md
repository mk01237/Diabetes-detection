Diabetes detection using tongue images
In this project, a prediction system to diagnose diabetes mellitus 
using tongue image is proposed. The system predicts the diabetes based on the features of the 
tongue like the colour distribution and texture etc.., The system extract features from the images 
and stores it. By using the features obtained and with the help of decision tree classifiers we can
predict the results. In this system we additionally implement the RESNET architecture over the 
other existing architectures which are used for this system.
